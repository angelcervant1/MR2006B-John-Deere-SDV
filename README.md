# Autonomous Car Development in collaboration with John Deere

- Project Timeline: August – December 2023

- Course: Industrial Automation

- Institution: Tecnológico de Monterrey

## Project Overview:
This project involved the design and development of a fully autonomous robot from scratch, combining mechanical, electronic, and software systems. The vehicle was programmed using C/C++ on an STM32 microcontroller, focusing on embedded systems, real-time control, and wireless telemetry.

The robot was designed to navigate autonomously toward predefined waypoints while maintaining stability and adaptability in dynamic environments. The system architecture integrated sensor data through sensor fusion algorithms using data from an accelerometer and wheel encoders to ensure precise motion control.

## Key Technical Contributions:

- Utilized STM32 microcontroller for real-time task execution, system reliability, and interrupt-driven control loops.

- Implemented PID-based motion control algorithms to handle path tracking and obstacle recovery.

- Developed a telemetry system over UART communication, interfacing with a Bluetooth module for real-time status monitoring and debugging.

- Employed modular C design patterns to enhance maintainability and scalability of the embedded firmware.

- Integrated wheel odometry and inertial sensor data to improve localization and stability of vehicle's motion.
